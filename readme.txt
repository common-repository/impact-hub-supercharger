This plugin adds custom posts "Entrepreneur toolbox" and "Member showroom" and a shortcode for displaying them.

== Description ==

This plugin was tailored for the Impact Hub Bergen site. And it might be useful for other sites that are looking to implement similar functionality.

Please note: This plugin is by no means officially supported by the Impact Hub company.

What the plugin does:

1. Adds the custom posts "Entrepreneur toolbox" and "Member showroom".
1. Make Entrepreneur toolbox be published as private by default.
1. Trim away the word "Private:" from private posts.
1. Enable custom shortcode for listing out custom posts. It includes pagination and support for displaying featured image.
1. Adds a custom hubmember role.
1. Add logged-in user role to the body class declaration. So that one might add styles to customize the admin view based on the logged in user's role.

Shortcode example usage:

* `[list-posts limit=3 type="impcthub-resource"]` Lists out Entrepreneur resource posts with max three posts on each page with "previous" and "next" links for pagination.
* `[list-posts limit=-1 type="impcthub-member"]` Lists out all Member showcase posts without pagination.
